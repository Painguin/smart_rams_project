# Title

# Abstract
The dataset is provided by Open Food Facts which is an open platform to collect varieties of data on food across the world. From this, one can extract appropriate information in order to answer some problem statements. For instance, in a framework of social good, one can analyze the ingredients of given products in order to warn customers about the (health and environmental) implications of what they are buying. It is also possible to track the food to learn the flux and the carbon footprint of different products. An analysis regarding packaging would be interesting as well; we could mesure the amount of plastic waste produced by the food industry.

# Research questions

### Global Food Industry Overview:

- What is the Carbon Impact of the food industry?
- What is the flux of the food industry?
  - This question could highlight some countries that export food but where there is starvation.

### Food Content:

- How many products contain controversial additives?
- Compare nutrition score of food (French/UK market)?
- What is the number of products containing palm oil?
- Is there a correlation between the price and the healthiness of the food. Can anyone afford to eat healthy?

# Dataset
We decided to use the Open Food Facts dataset from which we should be able to obtain all the informations regarding the research questions. In fact, the data contains a variety of attributes such as the carbon footprint, the production and sell locations and much more. For example if we want to analyse the healthiness of the product, we can rank them by analysing the amount of additives along with the nutrition facts by developping an arbitrary ranking system that could for example take into account additional features such as content of cholesterol or omega 3. As aforementionned, it is also possible to analyse insights and impacts of the industry. Indeed, with the information related to the materials of the packaging, it is possible to directly analyse the environmental impact by defining if the materials can be whether recycled or not. By adding to this the distance that the products travel to be delivered at their point of consumption, the impact of the transport can also be assessed. The ethics can also be analysed through this dataset. From the data, it is possilbe to derive the countries exporting food and compare it with the local starvation rate in either poor countries and emerging countries. The comparison between the exportation and importation can also reveal many trends. Another insight can be to analyse the nutrition scores of the food and find some correlations between the amount of the most sold products and the obesity rate in some countries.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- Get used to the data.
- Preprocess/Clean the data.
- Do some statistics in relation to the research questions
- Select a final interesting problem statement that could meaningfully take in account a maximum number of aforementionned features and related trend analysis.
