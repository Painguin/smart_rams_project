# Healthiness and Eco-Friendliness: Two Benchmarks for the Food Distribution

The dataset is obtained through an open source platform where information about food products are available and updatable by users.

# Abstract
This milestone consists in exploring and assess a first analysis of available data and their consistency in order to obtain a study scope. By exploring the dataset, most of the initial fields have been removed because of being either irrelevant for the analysis or presenting too many missing values. A reduced-field data set is thus obtained to study the healthiness and the eco-friendliness of products. The latter characteristics will subsequently be used to establish a ranking of brands, stores and countries.

# Analysis Strategy:

After exploring the dataset, some questions that were previously considered can’t be covered. For instance, the establishment of a relation between the healthiness food and revenues, will not be assessed as the information about prices is not available. Although, it is possible to study interesting facts. The exploration lead to a final study subject: The healthiness and Eco-Friendliness of brands and countries regarding food.

## Healthiness:

The healthiness is measured with the « Nutrition Score ». This data is available for many products and its calculation method is available. Although, that the number of missing values is high, these can be obtained through calculation based on the main macronutrients which are much largely available. The score is given through an alphabetical ranking that are derived based on numerical values. One will restaure the numerical values to make a more stringent ranking.

## Eco-Friendliness:

This information is not directly available in the dataset. It will be calculated based on two criterion: the packaging material and the distance between the origin of the product and its final purchasing country. For the packaging, one will consider if either it is recyclable or not. It is well known that the plastic used in the food industry is in general not recyclable except when it’s PET bottles. Glass bottles are also recyclable and will be considered this way. The carbon footprint is not available in the data, therefore, it will be replaced by the impact of distance travelled by the products. The calculation will be done with an average carbon emission per mass and kilometer.


# Expected Outcome:

The goal will be to rank brands, stores and countries based on the aforementioned criterion. It will even be possible to create an arbitrary label to do so. In addition, different links could be found. For example, it will possible to say if, generally the food of low-quality has a higher carbon footprint. It will be also possible to expose the countries that are more importers than exporters and assess their part of responsibility in making food travel (so the responsibility of ecological impact).
