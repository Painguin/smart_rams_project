# Abstract
The dataset is provided by Open Food Facts which is an open platform to collect varieties of data on food across the world. From this, one can extract appropriate information in order to answer some problem statements. For instance, in a framework of social good, one can analyze the ingredients of given products in order to warn customers about the (health and environmental) implications of what they are buying. It is also possible to track the food to learn the flux and the carbon footprint of different products. An analysis regarding packaging would be interesting as well; we could mesure the amount of plastic waste produced by the food industry.
